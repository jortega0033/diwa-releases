### 🎤 Real-Time Transcription

### 👻 Ghost Mode
Click-through transparency lets mouse events pass through. The overlay is **truly invisible** to screen shares.

### 📄 Context Injection
Upload your CV, job description, and company docs. AI tailors responses to your specific background.

### ⚡ ~200ms Latency
Real-time pipeline delivers responses fast enough to use mid-conversation. No awkward pauses.

### 👤 Multi-Persona System
Create personas for different roles. The AI becomes "Jake, Senior Engineer" with your background baked in.

### 🎨 Custom Response Styles
Choose from 8 built-in styles (Bullet Points, Conversational, STAR Method, etc.) or create your own custom prompt with optional "strict mode" for plain prose responses.

### 🔒 Secure & Private

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 🚨 Why does my computer say the app is "Unrecognized"?
Because we are in early Beta, we haven't bought expensive code-signing certificates yet.

- **macOS:** Right-click the app icon and select **Open**. (If you double-click, it might block you.)
- **Windows:** Click "More Info" → "Run Anyway".

### 🔑 Is my API Key safe?
Yes. We are a "Bring Your Own Key" app. Your key is stored **locally on your device** (encrypted via your OS Keychain). It is sent directly to OpenAI's servers to generate answers. It never touches our servers because **we don't have any servers**.

### 🎧 Why do I need Screen Recording permission on Mac?
macOS is strict about privacy and doesn't let apps capture system audio by default. Diwa Copilot uses macOS Screen Recording permission to capture system audio during calls.

**Pro Tip:** After enabling the permission, quit and relaunch Diwa Copilot to allow audio capture.

### 💰 Is it really free?
The app is free during the Beta period (until May 1, 2026). You only pay OpenAI for the API usage, which is usually pennies per interview.

## 🎨 Interface Design

### Obsidian Glass HUD
The overlay features a **minimalist "glass panel" design** that stays out of your way:

- **Floating Window** — Appears as a subtle, translucent panel above your video call
- **Real-Time Messages** — See both interviewer questions and AI responses in a clean chat-like interface
- **Status Indicator** — A pulsing green dot shows when Diwa is listening or processing
- **Smart Controls** — Compact control bar at the bottom with intuitive buttons:
  - ▶️ **Start/Stop** — Activate the session
  - 📌 **Pin** — Keep on top of other windows
  - 👻 **Ghost Mode** — Make even more invisible (click-through)
  - 🏠 **Main Window** — Quick access to settings
  - 🎤 **Mute** — Pause AI assistance
  - 🗑️ **Clear** — Reset transcript
  - 👁️ **Opacity Slider** — Adjust transparency (30-100%)

The entire interface is designed for **under 20ms of visual attention** — glance down, grab the answer, get back to the conversation. The glass aesthetic evokes a "layer of intelligence" floating invisibly above your screen.
